# flutter_sample_project

This project demonstrates my approach to building scalable, maintainable Flutter applications. It integrates clean architecture, state management with the Bloc/Cubit pattern, reusable UI components, and robust API interaction. Quality assurance is ensured through widget and unit testing.

Focusing on:

- Scalable and Maintanable clean architecture;
- State management;
- Dependency Injection;
- Widgets testing;
- Unit testing;
- Reusable UI components;
- API/network interaction.

Note: The purpose of this project is not to showcase pixel-perfect design or advanced UI capabilities, but rather to demonstrate my approach in overall mobile engineering practices, focusing on the core structure of a simple project.
My approach is not limited to this example, but rather adaptable and evolve based on the specific needs of each project.
\*The design is not the primary focus, and I do not claim ownership of it.
